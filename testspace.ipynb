So that’s good, she and I will both get some money back. I took my dogs to the pet store so my girl dog could get a new collar, but she wanted to beat everyone up. This is an ongoing issue with her. She’s so little and cute too but damn she acts like she’s gonna go for the jugular with everyone she doesn’t know! She did end up with a cute new collar tho, it has pineapples on it. I went to the dentist and she’s happy with my Invisalign progress. We have three more trays and then she does an impression to make sure my teeth are where they need to be before they get the rest of the trays. YAY! And I don’t have to make another payment until closer to the end of my treatment. I had some work emails with the festival, and Jessie was bringing up some important points, and one of our potential artists was too expensive to work with, so Mutual Friend was asking for names for some other people we could work with. So I suggested like, three artists, and Jessie actually liked the idea of one of them doing it. Which is nice. I notice she is very encouraging at whatever I contribute to our collective. It’s sweet. I kind of know this is like, the only link we have with each other right now besides social media, so it seems like she’s trying to make sure I know she still wants me to be involved and doesn’t have bad feelings for me. And there was a short period when I was seriously thinking of leaving the collective and not working with this festival anymore. I was so sad, and felt so upset, and didn’t know what to do about Jessie. It felt really close to me throwing in the towel. But I hung on through the festival and it doesn’t seem so bad from this viewpoint now with more time that has passed. And we have been gentle, if reserved, with each other. I mean her last personal email to me however many weeks ago wasn’t very nice. But it seems like we’ve been able to put it aside for work reasons. I dunno. I still feel like if anything was gonna get mended between us, she would need to make the first moves on that. I really don’t want to try reaching out and get rejected even as a friend again. I miss her though. And sometimes I think she misses me. But I don’t want to approach her assuming we both miss each other and have her turn it on me again and make out like all these things are all in my head. I don’t know about that butch I went on a date with last night. I feel more of a friend vibe from her, than a romantic one. I can’t help it, I am just not attracted to butches. And I don’t know how to flirt with them. And I don’t think of them in a sexy way. But I WOULD like another butch buddy. I mean yeah maybe Femmes do play games, or maybe I just chased all the wrong Femmes. Maybe I’ll just leave this and not think about it much until I get back to town in January.'"

    "for cluster in nlp(\"Today is the 10th anniversary of the day that Katy adopted me. It’s also the 4th anniversary of the day she left me. I’ve been wanting to pay tribute to her, but this week has been so frustrating with ups and downs and maybes. It took an episode of Life Below Zero to draw it out of me. For as long as I can remember, I wanted to be a mama. I got married young but wanted to wait until college was over and I was established in my career before we started a family. I began to have a nagging feeling right away, that I’d never have a baby. I thought I was going to die young. I prayed and prayed a selfish prayer that God would just let me have that experience before he took me. As you may or may not know, my marriage ended before children came along. I had one unplanned pregnancy after that, but it ended in disaster after only a few weeks. As those of you know who have had a baby in your womb but never got to hold her in your arms, there is a magical transformation that takes place that makes you a member of a new club. Tonight I am frustrated again. I’ve learned that the test that is required to determine my “disability status” will cost $800, and is not covered by my insurance. As I said, the ups and downs and maybes are taking their toll this week. When we got home, I warned Drew that I’m emotional and please don’t take it personally, and then plopped into my chair. He brought me dinner then put on Life Below Zero, where one of the men featured was calling to his dog and she wasn’t moving. I already had tears in my eyes and a lump in my throat, anticipating his loss. But as he reached into her house to touch her, she looked up at him and revealed a litter of puppies. I’ve been crying ever since. When Katy came along, she had big paws to fill. Magnum, my first dog, had been an absolute angel. He had the most gentle temperament, but he was also a fierce protector. It was years after losing him before I could think of getting another dog. But the time came, that I was ready for another dog. I was going to be moving into a house by myself and wanted a medium sized dog as an early warning alarm if nothing else. The woman who was trying to find a home for her told me that she’d been abandoned at a trailer park. She was tied to a trailer where she was fed scraps by various park residents. That’s why she was so fat. The woman brought Katy to my apartment to meet me. I sat down on the floor across the room, and said, “Hi, Katy!” She walked straight to me and laid her head in my lap. She cuddled me like it was a familiar place for her. I think we both knew she was home. Katy was ravenous that first week or so. She’d ransack the garbage at night and she’d inhale her food. I’d accidentally left out a log of premium wet dog food. She had eaten half of it by the time I realized it. I couldn’t understand why she was so hungry, but I understood why she was so fat now. Or so I thought. One day I came home from work and found her laying in the kitchen with her head propped against a cabinet. I suddenly suspected that she wasn’t just fat, she might be pregnant! I got down on the floor with her and put my hands on her belly. I could feel the babies moving around!\")._.coref_clusters:\n",

    "text = 'November was a trying month… on the 7th Dante had a major accident. 5 minutes before school and he and some friends are climbing the fence, I tell him it’s not a good idea and to get down. I turn back to talk to Jodi (on of my best mom friend’s at the school) and Dante comes to me screaming with his hand full of blood. I run him into my classroom and get him to the sink, as I turn on the water to clean the area the flap of his thumb lifts away and I see the bone. Shit. This isn’t something I can fix here, I grab my first aid kit and wrap it like crazy because it’s bleeding like crazy. I phone James and tell him to get to the ER as Dante is screaming and freaking out in the background as I’m trying to usher him back to the car as he’s bleeding like a stuffed pig. Unfortunately in the ER I learned that my child doesn’t take to freezing, an hour of gel freezing and he still felt the 2 needles as they went in, 15 minutes later and he felt the last 2 stitches of 8. He needed more because his finger still had gaps, the doctor didn’t want to cause him anymore pain so he glued them. It was an intense and deep gash that spiraled all the way up his thumb. I was trying to stay strong for him but I did break down as he screamed and cried, I was left to emotionally drained that day. James was able to take the remainder of the day off and stay with him. He missed 2 more days of school and then had an extra long weekend due to the holiday and the pro day but for 2 weeks he couldn’t write (of course it was his right hand.) 3 doctor visits later and he finally got them out full last week, the first visit the doctor wanted them in longer because of the severity. 2nd time he could only get 6 out because the glue had gotten on the last 2 stitches and he didn’t want to have to dig them out so we had to soak and dissolve the glue for 3 days. 3rd time the last 2 came out.  Even now he’s slowly regaining his writing skills as there was some nerve damage.'"
